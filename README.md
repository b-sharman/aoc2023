These are the solutions I wrote for Advent of Code 2023. My CS classes were in C++ at the time, so I wrote most of these in C++ to get better at it. However, sometimes I used Python just for NumPy.

I've since unified all my AoC solutions into a [single repository](https://github.com/b-sharman/adventofcode).
